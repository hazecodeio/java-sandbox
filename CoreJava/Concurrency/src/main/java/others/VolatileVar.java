/**
 * to understand how Volatile works on variables, we have to understand how Main Memory and CPU Memory work together.
 * Main Memory: this the RAM
 * CPU Memory: this is the Cache. it's local to threads | Stack
 * A thread always read/write from/to its local memory; CPU Cache
 * <p>
 * Volatile is always confused to be same as Synchronization; which is not true.
 * Volatile: means read from main memory to CPU cache, and when writing back then write it to the main memory as well.
 * if a variable is not Volatile, the read/write from/to main memory won't happen; Dirty Cache!
 * <p>
 * You can have both static synchronized method and non static synchronized method and synchronized blocks in Java
 * but we can not have synchronized variable in java.
 * Using synchronized keyword with variable is illegal and will result in compilation error.
 * Instead of synchronized variable in Java, you can have java volatile variable,
 * which will instruct JVM threads to read value of volatile variable from main memory and donâ€™t cache it locally
 * <p>
